(* Exercise 1.2.

   Implement a game AI that just picks a random available position. Feel free
   to raise if there is not an available position.

   After you are done, update [compute_next_move] to use your
   [random_move_strategy]. *)

(* [compute_next_move] is your Game AI's function.

   [game_ai.exe] will connect, communicate, and play with the game server,
   and will use [compute_next_move] to pick which pieces to put on your
   behalf.

   isn't yet over, so feel free to raise in cases where there are no
   available spots to pick. *)
